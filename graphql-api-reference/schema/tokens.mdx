- `listed_at`: (timestamp) - The timestamp when the token was listed on an exchange, indicating its availability for trading.
- `name`: (String!) - The name of the token, used to identify it.
- `price_usd`: (float8) - The current price of the token in USD, reflecting its market value.
- `reserve_usd`: (float8!) - The reserve value of the token in USD, representing the backing or reserve for the token.
- `symbol`: (String!) - The symbol of the token, such as ETH for Ethereum, used for trading and identification.

# Query examples

#### Query all tokens

```graphql
query {
  tokens {
    address
    name
    symbol
    price_usd
    total_supply
  }
}
```

#### Query a specific token

```graphql
query {
  tokens(where: { symbol: { _eq: "ETH" } }) {
    address
    name
    symbol
    price_usd
    total_supply
  }
}
```

#### Query tokens with pagination

```graphql
query {
  tokens(limit: 10, offset: 10) {
    address
    name
    symbol
    price_usd
    total_supply
  }
}
```

#### Query tokens with ordering

```graphql
query {
  tokens(order_by: { price_usd: desc }) {
    address
    name
    symbol
    price_usd
    total_supply
  }
}
```

#### Query tokens with filtering

```graphql
query {
  tokens(where: { total_supply: { _gt: 1000000 } }) {
    address
    name
    symbol
    price_usd
    total_supply
  }
}
```

#### Query tokens with related assets

```graphql
query {
  tokens {
    address
    name
    symbol
    price_usd
    total_supply
    asset {
      name
      symbol
      price_usd
      market_cap_usd
    }
  }
}
