## Filters model

The filters model is used to filter the data you want to receive from the stream. The filters are applied to the data before it is sent to the client.

```json
{
  "name": "MyWalletTransactions",
  "chainId": ["evm:1", "evm:56"],
  "events": ["trace", "log", "trasaction", "block", "swap"],
  "filters": {
    "and": [
      { "eq": ["action.from", "0x123456789"] },
      { "eq": ["transaction.receipt.status", "0x1"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Multiple filters

You can use multiple filters to get the data you need. The filters are applied in the order they are defined.

```json
{
  "or": [
    {
      "and": [
        { "eq": ["log.address", "0x0000000000000000003456000000008766600000"] },
        { "gte": ["log.logIndex", "1"] },
      ],
    },
    {
      "and": [
        { "eq": ["transaction.transaction.to", "0x0000000000000000003456000000008766600000"] },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```
