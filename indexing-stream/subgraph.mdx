Deploying a subgraph on Mobula is as easy as deployed to The Graph hosted services.
You simply need to refer to the network name as described in the [blockchains](/blockchains/intro-blockchains) section, and link to Mobula's node:

    ```bash
    graph deploy --node http://subgraph.mobula.io:8000  --ipfs http://subgraph.mobula.io:5001
    ```

Regarding auth, please read [this section](/indexing-stream/authentification).

If you're not familiar to The Graph, please explore their [documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/) to get started.
