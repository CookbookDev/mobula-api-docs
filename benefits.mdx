### üêô Octopus

Octopus is the most advanced pricing engine in the industry, offering the
largest coverage, the highest accuracy, the lowest latency, and the most
cost-efficient pricing.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Industry leading coverage" icon="radar">
    __Octopus__ engine, a multi-chain & composable system, tracks *all* assets
    __from Monero to the latest token listed on any DEX__, offering both pair
    exchange rates and aggregated prices. It combines the strengths of providers
    with limited (manual) coin coverage and those focusing on DeFi tokens.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Highly accurate" icon="bullseye-pointer">
    __Octopus__ engine combines volume aggregation & liquidity ponderation to
    provide the most accurate prices - even for low-cap altcoins / deadcoins.
    This pricing is used by some of the largest DeFi protocols through our
    Oracles partners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Built for real time" icon="rocket">
    __Octopus__ engine updates prices every 5s, with no cache (even for free
    versions!) and covers WSS & database streams.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cost-efficient, pay-as-you-go" icon="circle-dollar">
    With the most generous free tier in the industry, many companies __saved
    thousands of dollars__ by switching to Mobula.
