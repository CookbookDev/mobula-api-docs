## Why use Mobula APIs?

Mobula market data covers 1,300,000 crypto-tokens on 17 blockchains - historical data starting in 2013. Meta-data is curated by a DAO, its reliability can be assessed on-chain.

Mobula wallet data computes a multi-chain portfolio of any wallet - historical balances (allowing to build portfolio charts) as well as PNL breakdown for each traded asset. Mobula DeFi quotes (Meta-DEX aggregator) fetch all DEX aggregators (1inch, Kyberswap, etc.) to provide a unified ranking of the swap quotes available on 17 blockchains - no smart-contract involved on Mobula’s end.

## Start now

To make your life easier, we don’t require an API key to get started - however, it’s highly recommended to generate one, as requests without API keys will get important rate limits (1 query / 15 seconds).
