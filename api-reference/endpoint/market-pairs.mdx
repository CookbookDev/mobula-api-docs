### Query details

You must input a blockchain IF you send a smart-contract, but it's not mandatory otherwise (blockchain format can be found here) - you can otherwise use the name of the asset if it's listed in our metadata curated assets collection (+15,000 assets, adding tens everyday). In case of a naming collision, we will always take the asset with the highest market cap.

### Data details

Price data is computed using Octopus, Mobula's market data engine. You can have a high-level overview of how it's computing DeFi prices [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x6483Ca5ac1EbC6eB08d36979d217db2572CbAad2/Lw8NSSjqR4JSzthKZQCfHLwD3NPGsuaAfHGMY1zi-WI).

Protocols covered right now includes: Uniswap V2 and all +800 forks, Uniswap V3 and all +30 forks, Balancer V2/V3 (and forks), TraderJoe 2.1, Camelot stableswaps & all SUI DEXes.

Pairs are sorted by volume, then by liquidity - sent 25 by 25, use offset parameter to iterate over them (contact us if you need a higher limit).
