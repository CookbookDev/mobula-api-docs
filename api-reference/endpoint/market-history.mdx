### Query details

You must input a blockchain IF you send a smart-contract, but it's not mandatory otherwise (blockchain format can be found here) - you can otherwise use the name of the asset if it's listed in our metadata curated assets collection (+15,000 assets, adding tens everyday). In case of a naming collision, we will always take the asset with the highest market cap.
Also note that if you're querying with a from/to that doesn't have _any_ entry (because too close), we will revert with an empty array.

### Data details

Price data is computed using Octopus, Mobula's market data engine. You can have a high-level overview of how it's computing DeFi prices [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x6483Ca5ac1EbC6eB08d36979d217db2572CbAad2/Lw8NSSjqR4JSzthKZQCfHLwD3NPGsuaAfHGMY1zi-WI).
Data granularity is designed as follows:

- 5 minutes for the last 7 days
- 6 hours for the last 30 days
- 1 hour for the remaining of history

If you need higher granularity or control, please reach out to us [on Telegram](https://t.me/MobulaPartnerBot?start=Mobula_API_History) - we can deliver up to 1min granularity since 2013 for all assets.
