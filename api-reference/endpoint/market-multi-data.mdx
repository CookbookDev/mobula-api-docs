### Query details

You can query up to 500 assets as the same time (even tho if you are facing this you might want to use [our data streams](/api-reference/beta/introduction_highlevel)) - you must input a blockchain IF you send a smart-contract, but it's not mandatory otherwise (blockchain format can be found here).
For example, you can query with parameters:

```json
{
  "assets": "Bitcoin,0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0,Hedera,0x23d29d30e35c5e8d321e1dc9a8a61bfd846d4c5c"
  "blockchains": "1,137"
}
```

We will map the first blockchain with the first contract address found, and so on.

It is also possible to query using symbols - in that situation mobula sorts all assets with the same symbol and returns the one with the highest market cap - particularly useful if you need to map data coming from CEX trading pairs - if symbol is used, asset isn't mandatory anymore.

### Data details

Price data is computed using Octopus, Mobula's market data engine. You can have a high-level overview of how it's computing DeFi prices [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x6483Ca5ac1EbC6eB08d36979d217db2572CbAad2/Lw8NSSjqR4JSzthKZQCfHLwD3NPGsuaAfHGMY1zi-WI). `volume` is on-chain volume, and `off_chain_volume` is - as name implies, the off-chain volume.
