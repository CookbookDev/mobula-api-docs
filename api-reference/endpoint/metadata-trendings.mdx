### Query quick start

To access trending data for assets, use the platform parameter to filter results by a specific source: either CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko or LamboTrendings. This will return assets trending on the specified platform. If no platform is specified, the endpoint will return trendings across all supported platforms.

Additionally, you can now use the blockchain parameter to filter trendings by a particular blockchain, such as ?blockchain=ethereum. This new feature narrows down the results to only include assets trending on the specified blockchain.

### Data details

Our meta-trendings are a grouping of trendings from several asset aggregation platforms:

- CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/trending-cryptocurrencies/
- CoinGecko: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/search/trending
- LamboTrendings (Mobula Trendings): Setup based on the usage on our [buy bot](https://t.me/LamborghiniBuyBot)

The trendings are updated:

- Every 15 mins

We retrieve the top 15 of each platform and calculate a “trending score” based on the ranking and platform of each asset.

Rank 1 = 15 points

Rank 2 = 14 points

Rank 3 = 13 points

Rank 4 = 12 points

…

We add a special multiplier (weight in the endpoint response) according to the platform on which the asset is located:

- LamboTrendings: x1.2
- CoinMarketCap: x1
- CoinGecko: x0.8

So for example:

Rank 1 CoinGecko = 15 \* 0.8 = 12

Rank 1 CoinMarketCap = 15 \* 1 = 15

Rank 1 LamboTrendings = 15 \* 1.2 = 18

And finally, if an asset is ranked on several platforms, we add up the score of each platform together, for example:

```json
  {
    "id": 100005597,
    "name": "Hedera",
    "symbol": "HBAR",
    "contracts": [
      {
        "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000163b5a",
        "blockchain": "Hedera",
        "decimals": 8
      }
    ],
    "logo": "https://metacore.mobula.io/66cb844bf3f59d5593f48ef2954b8a439455a629c23d00faf38813820bac2119.png",
    "trending_score": 25.4,
    "platforms": [
      { "name": "CoinMarketCap", "rank": 1, "weight": 1 },
      { "name": "CoinGecko", "rank": 3, "weight": 0.8 }
    ],
    "price_change_24h": -6.780622,
    "pair": "0xc5b707348da504e9be1bd4e21525459830e7b11d"
  },
```

Here for Hedera

Rank 1 CoinMarketCap = 15 \* 1 = 15

Rank 3 CoinGecko = 13 \* 0.8 = 10.4

so,

trending_score = 15 + 10.4 = 25.4
