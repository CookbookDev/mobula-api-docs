### Query quick start

Input in “asset” the name of the asset you want to query, or the contract address while adding the blockchain as a second parameter. The market data asset query pattern is explained [in great details here](/api-reference/docs/market-asset-query), with blockchain format, etc.

### Data details

Price data is computed using Octopus, Mobula's market data engine. You can have a high-level overview of how it's computing DeFi prices [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x6483Ca5ac1EbC6eB08d36979d217db2572CbAad2/Lw8NSSjqR4JSzthKZQCfHLwD3NPGsuaAfHGMY1zi-WI). `volume` is on-chain volume, and `off_chain_volume` is - as name implies, the off-chain volume.
