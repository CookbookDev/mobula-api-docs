### Query details

You must input a blockchain IF you send a smart-contract, but it's not mandatory otherwise (blockchain format can be found [here](/blockchains/intro-blockchains)) - you can otherwise use the name of the asset if it's listed in our metadata curated assets collection (+15,000 assets, adding tens everyday). In case of a naming collision, we will always take the asset with the highest market cap.

It is also possible to query using symbol - in that situation mobula sorts all assets with the same symbol and returns the one with the highest market cap - particularly useful if you need to map data coming from CEX trading pairs - if symbol is used, asset isn't mandatory anymore.

### Data details

Price data is computed using Octopus, Mobula's market data engine. You can have a high-level overview of how it's computing DeFi prices [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x6483Ca5ac1EbC6eB08d36979d217db2572CbAad2/Lw8NSSjqR4JSzthKZQCfHLwD3NPGsuaAfHGMY1zi-WI). `volume` is on-chain volume, and `off_chain_volume` is - as name implies, the off-chain volume.
