title: Get Historical Market Data (batch)
openapi: get /market/multi-history

<Tip> Timestamps are in MS, it's JS timestamps. </Tip>

### Query details

You can query up to 500 assets as the same time (even tho if you are facing this you might want to use [our data streams](/rest-api-reference/beta/introduction_highlevel)).

The market data asset query pattern is explained [in great details here](/rest-api-reference/docs/market-asset-query), with blockchain format, etc.
For example, you can query with parameters:

```json
{
  "assets": "Bitcoin,0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0,Hedera,0x23d29d30e35c5e8d321e1dc9a8a61bfd846d4c5c"
  "blockchains": "1,137"
}
```

We will map the first blockchain with the first contract address found, and so on.

<Tip>
  Need more than 500 assets? You can use the [/all](/rest-api-reference/endpoint/all)
  endpoint to get all assets listed on Mobula (curated, not all DeFi tokens)
</Tip>

### Data details

Price data is computed using Octopus, Mobula's market data engine. You can have a high-level overview of how it's computing DeFi prices [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x6483Ca5ac1EbC6eB08d36979d217db2572CbAad2/Lw8NSSjqR4JSzthKZQCfHLwD3NPGsuaAfHGMY1zi-WI).
Data granularity is designed as follows:

- 5 minutes for the last 7 days
- 6 hours for the last 30 days
- 1 day for the remaining of history

If you need higher granularity or control, please reach out to us [on Telegram](https://t.me/MobulaPartnerBot?start=Mobula_API_History) - we can deliver up to 1min granularity since 2013 for all assets.
