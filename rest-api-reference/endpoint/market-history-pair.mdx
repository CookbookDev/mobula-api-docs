openapi: get /market/history/pair
---

### Query quick start

Input in "address" field the contract address of the pair/pool you want to query. You can also query via asset explained [in great details here](/rest-api-reference/docs/market-asset-query) and it will return the largest pair's data for this asset.
By default, MEV data is not included in the response.

### Data details

Available resolutions:

- 1min
- 5min
- 15min
- 1h
- 2h
- 4h
- 1d
- 7d
- 30d

### Troubleshoot

By default, the amount param is set to 1000, and has priority over from/to params - which means if you set a very large timeframe, which low granularity, and don't adapt the amount parameter, it will be capped at 1000 entries. You can increase the amount parameter to get more data points.

### Get a specific timeframe

The current endpoint is designed to serve TradingView user interface, which isn't thinking with timeframes but with candle amounts. If no trades are happening in a given timeframe, the amount of candles will be reduced to the amount of intervals where trades happened.
To get a specific timeframe, you can use the `from` and `to` parameters, coupled with "amount" being set to : `to - from` / resolution - and filter out manually the data points that are not in the timeframe you want.
